# PersonalSite
Personal Website for my projects, resume, and portfolio

2/1/2020
- Began working on updating my Personal Website
- Used Bootstrap NavBar
  - Learned how to troubleshoot and use 3rd party JS/CSS/HTML Libraries for use
  - Learned how to use multiple classes and change objects to reflect my vision of the site
- Used JQUERY
  - Learned about loading the library then the plugin or else you get a reference error
  - Learned to use classes as targets for certain actions. In this case to hide the navbar on clicking a nav-item without losing
  the ability to link to other parts of the webpage.
  
For 2/2/2020
- Update the UA Logo to be smaller on desktop by using Columns/Rows from Bootstrap
- Start adding some color to the site to make it more upbeat, not as gray/bland
- Add more of my content.
